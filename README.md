# JetBrains Academy's Rock, Paper, Scissors project

## About
This program allows the user to play a game of rock, paper scissors against a computer opponent. It accepts any odd number of 'shapes' with which to create a game with e.g rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. The computer picks a random symbol and checks if a win, loss or draw has taken place. A rating system reads results from a previous game and records new results. See the wiki for more details.

## Learning objectives
* Using modules e.g random
* Default and keyword function arguments
* File handling and common methods
* Escape sequences
* List and string operations e.g indexing, slicing, split and join
